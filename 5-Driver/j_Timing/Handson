1.	User has to understand here use of Schdule function in kernel
	& how to use proc entry to wake up read operation
	But her concept of wait is not proper let us chcek in 2nd folder
	
2.	User has to understand here use of Schdule function in kernel
	& how to use proc entry to wake up read operation.
	Here read waits in running queue.

3.	User has to understand here use of Schdule function in kernel
	& how to use proc entry to wake up read operation.
	Here read waits in running queue for particular letter.
	
4.	User has to understand here use of Schdule function in kernel
	& how to use proc entry to wake up read operation.
	Here read doesn't waits in runing queue It will woken up as soon 
	as PROC entry done waits in sleeping state.
	For this we need two terminals one is serial & another is tftp
	
5.  User has to understand how interruptible wait works
	For this we need two terminals one is serial & another is tftp
	
6.  Here user has to start first read operation then it waits for flag 
	in while loop once user do PROC entry then only while loop breaks & 
	more over read operation while looks for particular letter from PROC
	For this we need two terminals one is serial & another is tftp
	
7.	User has to understand how read operation waits untill 
	write operation writes. 
	For this we need two terminals one is serial & another is tftp

8.	User has to understand how read operation waits untill 
	write operation writes. But here read operation waits for some 
	particular data from write operation 
	for this we need two terminals one is serial & another is tftp
	
9.  Created 10 threads here you will get to know when you do write entry 
	then all process wakes up 

10. But exclusive waits take care here it waks up one last process
